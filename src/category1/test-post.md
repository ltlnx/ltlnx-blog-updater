# Test Post

This is a test post to demonstrate what the script would do to every post.

The first heading 1 title (starting with a `#`) would be the title shown in every file listing this post is in.

To add dates to the file listings, all you have to do is add some text to the bottom (or anywhere) in your page that says this:

_Last updated: 2023-01-01_

You can even make it italicized, as it doesn't matter to the script.
