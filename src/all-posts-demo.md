# All Pages / Other Pages Demo

You can add Markdown files in the source directory without putting them under any category directory, and they would be classified under "Other Pages" (or if there's no category, "All Pages").

Also if you didn't specify a date like the post in Category1, it would show a `(No Date)` tag beside the file in file listings.
