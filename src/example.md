# example post

This post is an example post. If the post is in the "sticky" folder, it won't have a date in the URL, and would be directly put in the base directory instead. Useful for non-post material like about pages.

Add tags at the end of the post starting with `Tags: ` and a list of comma-separated tags.

For dates, add one line that has a date on its own, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
