<p>This is a test post to demonstrate what the script would do to every
post.</p>
<p>The first heading 1 title (starting with a <code>#</code>) would be
the title shown in every file listing this post is in.</p>
<p>To add dates to the file listings, all you have to do is add some
text to the bottom (or anywhere) in your page that says this:</p>
<p><em>Last updated: 2023-01-01</em></p>
<p>You can even make it italicized, as it doesn’t matter to the
script.</p>
